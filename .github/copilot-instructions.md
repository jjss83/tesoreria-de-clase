# Copilot Instructions

## Purpose

These instructions provide general guidance for GitHub Copilot across the workspace. For specific project context and domain knowledge, refer to the specialized instruction files in the `.github/instructions/` directory.

## Instruction Files

This workspace uses multiple instruction files for different contexts:

- **`copilot-context.instructions.md`**: Treasury management system context and project-specific guidelines
- **`tdd-guidelines.instructions.md`**: Test-driven development and simplicity-first principles  
- **`typescript-guidelines.instructions.md`**: TypeScript/Node.js specific development guidelines
- **`changelog-management.instructions.md`**: Changelog update instructions for CHANGELOG.md files

## General Approach

- Follow test-driven development principles
- Prioritize simplicity and clarity over complexity
- Reference project documentation before making architectural suggestions
- Consider the treasury management domain context in all suggestions
- Maintain consistency with established patterns and conventions

## Documentation Integration

For any development work, always reference the relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory and follow the guidelines established in the specialized instruction files.
