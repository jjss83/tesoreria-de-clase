### Automation Guidelines

Update the changelog when:
- ‚úÖ New features are implemented or modified
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes are applied that affect user experience
- ‚úÖ Performance improvements are made
- ‚úÖ API changes occur (MCP tools, CLI commands)
- ‚úÖ Data schema modifications happen
- ‚úÖ Security improvements are implemented
- ‚úÖ Configuration or default behavior changes

Do NOT update for:
- ‚ùå Pure code style or formatting changes
- ‚ùå Test file modifications without functional impact
- ‚ùå Build script or development tool updates
- ‚ùå Documentation-only changes (unless user-facing)
- ‚ùå Dependency updates without feature impact

### Update Process

When updating `CHANGELOG.md`:

1. **Preserve Structure**: Maintain existing format and organization
2. **Update Unreleased Section**: Add all new entries under `## [Unreleased]`
3. **Maintain Category Order**: Keep standard sequence (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)
4. **Use Consistent Dating**: Apply ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for version releases
5. **Group Related Changes**: Combine similar modifications into comprehensive entries
6. **Verify Accuracy**: Ensure all significant user-facing changes are captured
